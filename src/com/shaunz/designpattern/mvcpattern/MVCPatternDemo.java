/**
 * 
 * MVC Pattern stands for Model-View-Controller Pattern. This pattern is used to separate application's concerns.
 * Model - Model represents an object or JAVA POJO carrying data. It can also have logic to update controller if its data changes.
 * View - View represents the visualization of the data that model contains.
 * Controller - Controller acts on both model and view. 
 * It controls the data flow into model object and updates the view whenever data changes. It keeps view and model separate.\
 * <b>Implementation</b>
 * We are going to create a Student object acting as a model. 
 * StudentView will be a view class which can print student details on console and StudentController is the controller class responsible to store data in Student object and update view StudentView accordingly.
 * MVCPatternDemo, our demo class, will use StudentController to demonstrate use of MVC pattern.
